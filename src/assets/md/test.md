# About Me

Hi! I'm Kevin, a Computer Science and Data Science graduate from UC Berkeley. I work as a software engineer at Amazon. Previously, I worked as a software engineer at Addadday LLC. During my time at Berkeley I also TA'd for the CS61A, Data 100, and Data 144 classes.

I also teach and play chess quite a bit- I'm a Candidate Master with a USCF rating of 2176. Feel free to contact me if you ever want to play a game!

My projects are all detailed on my [Github](https://github.com/kmoy1).

If you want to get in touch with me, feel free to shoot me an email any time at [kevinmoy@berkeley.edu](mailto:kevinmoy@berkeley.edu ).
